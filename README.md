# Flood Survivor Detection through Image Fusion and Yolo model

Natural disasters like flood happen when water 
overtakes normally dry places. During rescue missions aimed at 
saving lives, rescue teams responding to floods encounter 
numerous obstacles. Locating and discovering survivors is a vital 
component of rescue operations. For quick flood survivor 
recognition, the suggested approach combines image fusion with 
the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, offering a novel method. 
This model utilizes image fusion by merging data from various
sources, including RGB and Near Infrared Red (NIR) images
captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In order to 
efficiently identify flood survivors and aid rescue crews in their 
effort to preserve lives, the resulting fused image is processed 
using the YOLO model.
